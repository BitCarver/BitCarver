- I'm a Dad to 2 amazing kiddos and Husband to my incredible wife!
- When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me exploring North Carolina's beauty by walking on the beach and making sand castles with my kids, fishing (for drum, trout, or flounder!), or cruising on a Carolina Skiff. You can also catch me playing ARPG's or whipping up something delicous in the kitchen.
