- Advanced TypeScript techniques and performance optimization.
- Developing iOS and web apps with a focus on user-first design.
- Diving deeper into backend technologies and scalable architectures.
- Studying for IT Certifications. Currently working on CompTIA A+ with plans to get Network+ and Security+ soon!
### 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on:

### ⚡ Fun fact:
- I'm a Dad to 2 amazing kiddos and Husband to my incredible wife!
- When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me exploring North Carolina's beauty by walking on the beach and making sand castles with my kids, fishing (for drum, trout, or flounder!), or cruising on a Carolina Skiff. You can also catch me playing ARPG's or whipping up something delicous in the kitchen.
